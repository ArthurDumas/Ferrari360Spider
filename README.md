![Ferrari 360 Spider](/2001%20Ferrari%20360%20Spider.jpg "Ferrari 360 Spider")

> This is a great first Ferrari! When shopping for a used Ferrari, the most important thing to look at is the maintenance history and whether the common service issues have been dealt with. This car has been well maintained and all of the critical updates have been completed including the 3 bolt starter ring replaced with the 6 bolt design and cam variators replaced with updated parts.

## Additional Information

I am listing these items in the spirit of full transparency and no surprises. Several of these items are nit-picky but if you come to look at the car, I want you to know exactly what to expect.

- The paint is in good shape but is not perfect.
- Seats show some dye wear on side bolster.
- Some interior sticky bits, but not on anything you regularly touch.
- Manual seats fore and aft sliding adjustment requires some effort.
- Dash leather looks good but the plastic vents by the windshield are slightly loose. This isn't something you notice unless you touch them which you would never do. Metal replacement vents included but require installation.
- The wind deflector screen material behind the passenger's head is coming loose from the frame. All 3 windscreens can be had for about $250 from [Cabrio Supply](https://www.cabriosupply.com/ferrari-360-und-f430-spider-wind-deflector-2000-2009).
- One of the little plastic carpet pegs that holds the passenger footwell carpet in place is loose.
- Convertible top has 2 small snags ([see photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pHHpTnUoHpVyuHNxkVJY5SI1nRhGxGY_?usp=sharing)) which you will see on many Ferrari 360s and 430s. These snags aren't holes and the top doesn't leak. I have been caught in a couple of severe Florida downpours and there are no leaks. Contrary to some peoples' opinions, Ferraris don't melt in the rain.
